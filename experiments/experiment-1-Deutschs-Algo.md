# Deutsch's Algorithm

### Background
David Deutsch attemps to show the differences of quantum computing and classical computing using the simplest possible algorithm

### Alogrithm
Given an oracle, a binary function f:{0,1}->{0,1}, find out if it is a constant function (gives all 0s or all 1s) or balance function (half the time 0 and half the time 1). It is possible to only invoke oracle once to verify the function using Quantum Parallelism.

### Quantum Circuit

#### |x,y> -> |x, y âŠ• f(x)>
The trick is to use XOR gate to construct a f-CNOT gate to test the function if it is a constant or balance one.

As you can see, it first prepare two qubits repectively at |0> and |1> state. It then superpositions both qubits. By applying XOR function for the result of f(x) and the second qubit y, the sign of the result states will change. By apply Hadamard gate again to first qubits, the signal will then reveal if the function is a constant one or a balanced one.
